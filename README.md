## Feautes
* Free piano play
* Interactive note reading and piano playing course
* Help mode highlighting the next correct key
* Scrollable and resizable keyboard
* Help labels

## Installation
I'll published the app in the future on the App Store, until then you can clone this repository and run it on your iPad with the Swift Playgrounds app.
If you clone this project from GitHub, you'll need to add **.swiftpm** to the enclosing folder in order to be able to open this project in Xcode or Swift Playgrouds.
